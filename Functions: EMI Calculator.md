# Fuctions: EMI Calculator in C (Function Without Return Type With Arguments)

This repository contains a **C program** to calculate the **Equated Monthly Installment (EMI)** using a function that has **no return type but accepts arguments**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim

To write a C program that calculates the EMI for a loan using a function **without return type and with arguments**.

## ðŸ“‹ Algorithm

1. Start the program.
2. Read input values from the user:
   - Principal amount (`p`)
   - Rate of interest (`r`)
   - Loan duration in months (`t`)
3. Pass these values as arguments to a function.
4. Inside the function, calculate the EMI using the formula:
5. EMI = (p * r * pow(1 + r, t)) / (pow(1 + r, t) - 1)

 Note: Ensure the rate `r` is converted to a monthly rate (i.e., divide annual rate by 12 * 100).

5. Display the EMI result.
6. Stop the program.
