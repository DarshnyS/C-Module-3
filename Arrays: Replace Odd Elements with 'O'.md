# Arrays: Replace Odd Elements with 'O' in an Array

This repository contains a **C program** that reads a one-dimensional array of integers and **replaces all odd elements with the character `'O'`** when displaying the output.

## ðŸ§  Aim

To write a C program that replaces all odd elements of an array with `'O'`.

## ðŸ“‹ Algorithm

1. Declare integer variables: `i`, `n` and an array `a[100]`.
2. Read the value of `n` (number of elements in the array) from the user.
3. Read `n` integers into the array `a`.
4. Loop through each element of the array:
   - If the element is odd (`a[i] % 2 != 0`), print `'O'`.
   - Otherwise, print the element itself.
5. Print each result separated by a space.
